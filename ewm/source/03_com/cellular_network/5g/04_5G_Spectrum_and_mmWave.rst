Motivation and Challenges behind mmWave
=======================================

What is mmWave?

* Spectrum where radio wavelength is a few millimeters: above 24 GHz
* 5G mmWave spectrum is around 28GHz and 39 GHz
* Spectrum above 52 GHz is also being considered

Why mmWave?

* Currently, mmWave is largely unused --> ample spectrum available
* Enormous bandwidth -> mmWave can fulfull the demand of data-hungry 5G use cases

Challenges?

* Inferior propagation: higher frequency -> significantly higher path loss
* Building penetration loss: Deep indoor coverage is challenging
* Severe attenuation due to rain and foliage

Despite these challenges, 5G can leverage certain advantages of mmWave.

Advantages of high-frequency:

* Large bandwidth --> Less crowding
* More antennas --> Higher generation
* More directivity --> Better focus --> Higher spectral efficiency
* High Pathloss and directivity --> Better Spacial resource
