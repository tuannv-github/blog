Why Do We Need Something Beyond 4G
==================================

* Ultra-high speeds and network capability
* Low lag for real-time, interactive apps
* Diverse services under one umbrella
* Connecting everyone and everything

New Level of Capability and Efficiency
======================================

* Fiber-like speeds: Multi-Gbps peak rates for both download (consumption) and upload (sharing) 
* Lower latency: As low as 1ms for interactive content; reduced bufferring and lag 
* Uniform exerience: Reliable performance, e.g., 100+ Mbps, even in challenging environments
* Lower cost-per-bit: Significantly lower than today's networks to efficiently support cost-effective data plans


* **10x experienced throughput**
* **10x decrease in end-to-end latency**
* **10x connection density**
* **3x spectral efficiently**
* **100x traffic capacity**
* **100x network efficiency**

5G NR Service Classes
=====================

* eMMB: Enhanced Mobile Broadband. Further high-speed internet
* mMTC (mIoT): Massive Machine Type Communications. Massive Internet of Things. Connect everything about us.
* URLLC: Ultra-Reliable, Low-Latency Communications. Real-time, interactive apps

eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband)
================================

* Emphasis on higher speeds and spectral efficiency

  * Bandwidth and power usage is secondary

* Peak user date rate > 10Gbps
* Network throughput > 1Tbps
* Operation in macro and small cells
* Support for high-speed mobility up to 500kmph
  
MMTC (Massive Machine Type Communications)
==========================================

* Connecting not just people, but their worlds.
* Support for high device density
  
  * Up to 1 million devices/km2

* Operation over long range and in challenging coverage environment
* Simple, low-cost devices.
* Expectaion of very long battery life

  * Up to 10 years, for example
* Emphasis on power consumption and simplicity of protocols, instead of speed and efficiency

(URLLC) Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications
=================================================

* Ultra-responsive, instant connections necessary for mission-critical services.
* Emphasis on E2E latency, instead of speed

  * Less than 1 ms, for example 
* Ultra-high reliability and availability
  
  * For example, 99.9999%

* Support for high-speed mobility
* Fundamental redesign of protocols
