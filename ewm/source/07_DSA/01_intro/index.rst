Introduction
============

Variables
=========

.. math:: 
    
    x^2 + 2y - 2 = 1

Data types
==========

* System defined data types (Primitive data types) : int, float, char, double, bool, etc...

* User defined data types
    
  * struct in C/C++
  * class in Java

Data structure
==============

* **Linear data structure**: Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially (say, Linked Lists). Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.
* **Non-linear data structure**: Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order: Examples: Trees and Graphs

Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
==========================

An ADT consists of **two** parts:

#. Declaration of data
#. Declaration of operations

Examples: Stacks
----------------

#. LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) machanism while storing the data in data structures
#. Operations: creating, pushing eb element, popping an element, getting number of elements, etc...

What is an Algorithm
====================

An algorithm is the step-by-step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem.

**Two** criterias for judging the merits of algorithms:

* **Correctness** Does the algorithm give solution to the problem in a finite number of steps.
* **Efficiency** How much resources (in term of memory and time) does it take to execute the algorithm.

Why the Analysis of Algorithms?
===============================

In computer science, multiple algorithms are available for solving the same problem. Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorithm is most efficient in terms of time and space consumed.

Goal of the Analysis of Algorithm?
==================================

The goal of the analysis of algorithms is to compare algorithms (or solutions) mainly in terms of running time but also in terms of other factors (e.g. memory, developer effort, etc.)

What is Running Time Ananlysis?
===============================

It is the process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem increases.
